# Product Context: X-mas Shop

## 1. Problem
Users need a simple and festive online platform to browse and find Christmas-related products without the complexity of a full e-commerce site. The primary goal is to create an engaging and visually appealing showcase of items.

## 2. Solution
A single-page web application (`index.html`) that displays Christmas products in a clear and attractive layout. The focus is on the user experience of browsing, rather than purchasing.

## 3. User Experience Goals
- **Visual Appeal:** The site should have a festive, Christmas-themed design.
- **Simplicity:** Users should be able to easily navigate and view products without any complicated steps.
- **Clarity:** Product categories (gifts, cards, decorations) should be well-defined.
