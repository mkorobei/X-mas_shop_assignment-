## 1. Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing the project structure and creating the Memory Bank. The next step is to build out the basic HTML structure in `index.html`.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files.

## 3. Next Steps
- Create the basic HTML boilerplate in `index.html`.
- Add a header, main content area, and footer to the HTML.
- Link to a new CSS file for styling.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations
- The initial HTML structure should be semantic and well-organized to make it easy to style later.
- A separate CSS file should be used to keep the styles separate from the HTML.
